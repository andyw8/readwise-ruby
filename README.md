# Readwise

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/readwise.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/readwise) [![Ruby](https://github.com/joshbeckman/readwise-ruby/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/joshbeckman/readwise-ruby/actions/workflows/ruby.yml)

[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) is an application suite to store, revisit, and learn from your book and article highlights. This is a basic library to call the [Readwise API](https://readwise.io/api_deets) to read and write highlights.

This library is not at 100% coverage of the API, so if you need a method that is missing, open an issue or contribute changes!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'readwise'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install readwise

## Usage

First, obtain an API access token from https://readwise.io/access_token.

```ruby
client = Readwise::Client.new(token: token)

books = client.export # export all highlights
books = client.export(updated_after: '2023-01-17T22:02:48Z') # export recent highlights
books = client.export(book_ids: ['123']) # export specific highlights

puts books.first.title # books are Readwise::Book structs
puts books.first.highlights.map(&:text) # highlights are Readwise::Highlight structs

# create a highlight
create = Readwise::HighlightCreate.new(text: 'foobar', author: 'Joan')
highlight = client.create_highlight(highlight: create)

# update a highlight
update = Readwise::HighlightUpdate.new(text: 'foobaz', color: 'yellow')
updated = client.update_highlight(highlight: highlight, update: update)

# add a tag to a highlight
tag = Readwise::Tag.new(name: 'foobar')
added_tag = client.add_highlight_tag(highlight: highlight, tag: tag)

# update a tag on a highlight
added_tag.name = 'bing'
updated_tag = client.update_highlight_tag(highlight: highlight, tag: added_tag)

# remove a tag from a highlight
client.remove_highlight_tag(highlight: highlight, tag: added_tag)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
